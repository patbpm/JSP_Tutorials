# JSP Tutorials

John Purcell's courses are among the best for learning Java web development. As a former educator, I enhance my learning by creating parallel tutorials. Below are my notes and working code developed for John's course "Servlets and JSPs: Creating Web Applications With Java."

## Comprehensive Notes
Each project includes a comprehensive set of notes in the `JSP_notes` folder. Note files are named to reflect the videos they cover, such as `JSP_v5-10.txt`, which corresponds to videos 5 through 10.

### 2015 Edits
These notes have been significantly revised for clarity and organization. The last three `.txt` files underwent extensive editing, especially for line length to improve readability on tablets. Other files retain longer line lengths, which is suitable for larger monitors.

## WAR Files
Each project is compiled into a `.WAR` (Web Application Archive) file, simplifying the download and testing process on your local environment.

## Enhanced Learning
I hope these resources enrich your learning experience as you progress through John's excellent video tutorials and help you master JSPs!
